# Java Practices

Java Practices is a series of projects developed during school to introduce Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. These projects, originally created in NetBeans, were migrated to enhance understanding of Java fundamentals, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, providing a hands-on learning experience for mastering OOP principles.
